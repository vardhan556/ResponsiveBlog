                    <h2>Career in Software Engineer</h2><br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A software engineer designs, develops and builds computer software.
                        Every
                        piece of software and application you have on your computers and smartphones is probably
                        designed by
                        a team of software engineers. They are able to do this by learning the languages that computers
                        use
                        to operate. Computer engineering is in evergreen demand, making this an attractive career option
                        for
                        professionals who enjoy working with computers and creative problem-solving.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Software engineers mostly spend their days in an office setting behind a
                        desk. Most of their time may go towards working on current projects, with occasional team
                        meetings.
                        Many software engineers may also be able to work remotely. Software engineers may also have
                        flexible
                        working hours, provided they handle their workload and meet all their deadlines consistently.

                    <h2>What is crypto</h2><br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks
                        to
                        verify transactions. Itâ€™s a peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and
                        receive
                        payments. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world,
                        cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing
                        specific
                        transactions. When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a public
                        ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets. <br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Cryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify
                        transactions. This means advanced coding is involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency
                        data
                        between wallets and to public ledgers. The aim of encryption is to provide security and safety.
